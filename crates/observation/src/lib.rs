#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! Loss-aware local observation writer and query adapter.
//!
//! Ordinary logs are intentionally absent from this crate. The only truth inputs are the
//! adapter-facing execution-fact contract and the independent versioned content contract. The
//! writer owns activity/content mutations and never has access to routing/runtime correctness
//! state.
