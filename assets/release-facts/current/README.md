# Current client-bundled ReleaseFacts

This is the only production ReleaseFacts catalog in the MVP. It is generated with the client and
embedded directly into the daemon build. Production neither installs nor reads a second copy under
the mutable storage root. A later client revision replaces these build inputs in place; there is no
production generation selector, detached signature, release private key, signer approval, or older
production fallback.

Version suffixes that remain inside JSON schema names, adapter IDs, or HTTP paths describe wire
contract revisions only. They do not identify selectable model-catalog editions.

Generate and verify the checked-in bytes twice:

```sh
python3 assets/release-facts/current/prepare-bundle.py
python3 assets/release-facts/current/prepare-bundle.py --check
cargo run -p hiroute-release-facts -- check \
  --input assets/release-facts/current/compiler-input.json \
  --output-dir assets/release-facts/current/bundle
```

`compiler-input.json` is the reviewable compiler input. `bundle/` contains the exact manifest,
connector registry, model data, and agent profiles embedded in the client. Production pins the
exact manifest bytes in the same build and then validates the registry/model-data byte digests,
product identity, and cross-reference digest before exposing any catalog fact. Missing, stale, or
modified bytes fail closed.

Future HTTPS delivery is outside this MVP boundary and requires its own download authentication,
rollback, caching, and atomic-activation contract before it can replace this bundled catalog.
